# The Public Observatory

A public index of research agendas: questions, with their motivation and their decomposition into smaller questions, posed by anyone and worked on in public by people, laboratories and their agents. The website is at <https://public-observatory.github.io/>. `VISION.md` says what the Observatory is for.

## How it works

**An agenda is a git repository.** It holds `agenda.json`, which states the agenda's title, kind, root question, summary and maintainers, and a README giving its motivation, scope and standard of evidence. A new agenda is created from the template repository `Public-Observatory/agenda-template`, whose contents are `agenda-template/` here.

**Questions and claims are issues.** Each agenda has two issue forms, kept short: a question is stated in one field, a claim in the title, and everything else is optional. A claim names the questions it answers, by issue number; an approach that did not work is recorded as a claim too. Code, data and proofs arrive as pull requests that the claim links to.

**Maintainers govern by stated rules.** In an *open agenda* anyone may add subquestions; in a *closed agenda* the maintainers set the questions and accept only answers; a *problem* is a single question. Claims are reviewed in the comments on their issues, and a maintainer closes a question once it is answered.

**The index is the topic.** Every public repository with the topic `observatory-agenda` is listed, wherever it lives, so that no one controls admission. Every hour, `site/build.py` searches GitHub for the topic, reads each agenda's `agenda.json` and issues, and writes `agendas.json`; the static pages in `site/` render it. An agenda whose files cannot be read is left out and reported.

## Layout

```
VISION.md          what the Observatory is for
site/              the website: index.html, agenda.html, observatory.js and .css;
                   build.py builds agendas.json; agenda.py checks an agenda.json
agenda-template/   a new agenda's repository: agenda.json, README, issue forms, and a
                   workflow that checks agenda.json on every pull request
tests/             tests of site/agenda.py and site/build.py
```

## Development

```sh
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests                          # the tests; standard library only, Python 3.10+
python3 site/agenda.py check agenda-template/agenda.json       # exit 1, with the reasons, if malformed
mkdir -p _site && cp site/*.html site/*.css site/*.js _site/
python3 site/build.py local _site DIR...                       # index agendas in local directories, for a preview
python3 -m http.server -d _site                                # and serve it
```

A local agenda directory holds `agenda.json` and, optionally, `README.md` and `issues.json`, a list of issues as the GitHub API returns them. The index includes each repository's README, displayed on its agenda page and refreshed with the hourly build. Relative README links and images point back to the source repository. A missing README does not remove the agenda from the index.

README rendering uses vendored Marked 18.1.0 (`site/marked.js`, MIT) and DOMPurify 3.4.16 (`site/purify.js`, Apache-2.0 OR MPL-2.0); their license notices are included in the files.

An agenda's check fetches `site/agenda.py` from this repository; the agenda's variable `OBSERVATORY_REPO` points it at another copy.
